# Retailability

Making modern shopping more sustainable by keeping consumers informed of the environmental impacts of the products they choose to purchase.

To use, simply take out your phone, take a picture of the product or scan the barcode, and make an informed choice! We record purchases and your sustainability metrics so you can make the prudent financial and environmental decisions! We secure your data by salting and encrypting your login information to keep bad actors away.

This project is made using Python, Javascript, HTML, and CSS. Made using Flask, React, Firebase, PyTorch, and more!
